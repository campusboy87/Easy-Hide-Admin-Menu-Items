### Simplicity for the Average User

While there are numerous plugins available for hiding menus in the WordPress admin panel, many of them require additional settings and extra learning for the average user. Our plugin, **Easy Hide Admin Menu Items**, stands out from the alternatives with its simplicity and intuitive user interface.

Upon activation, a convenient toggle switch appears in the admin bar, allowing users to easily enable or disable hidden menus. Hovering over this toggle instantly reveals all hidden menus. Additionally, when hovering over any WordPress menu item, an icon appears, indicating that the menu can be hidden. If you choose to hide a specific menu, it seamlessly moves to the area of all hidden menus.

At any moment, you can quickly enable or hide menus, visually seeing all hidden items when hovering over the toggle. Thus, our plugin provides the simplest and most intuitive way to hide and manage menus, even for users without specialized WordPress management skills.

## Plugin Modes

The plugin provides two operational modes:

- **Global Mode:**
    - Allows hiding menus globally for all users according to common settings.

- **Individual Mode for Each User:**
    - When this option is activated, each user can customize the visibility and hiding of menus according to their individual preferences.

Thus, users can choose between the global mode and individual settings based on their needs. The settings page for the plugin is accessible in the "Settings" section of the WordPress admin panel under "Settings > Menu Settings."

### [ ] User-Specific Settings

Enabling this checkbox allows each user to save their settings individually. This provides the ability to customize menu item visibility for each user according to their preferences.

Note: The checkbox mentioned enables or disables the user-specific settings functionality. When the option is enabled, settings are stored in `user_meta`, and when disabled, they are stored in `get_option`.

### [ ] Hide Submenus

Activate this option to easily manage the visibility of submenus in your WordPress admin panel. When this option is enabled, you can hide submenus, which is particularly useful when your admin panel is rich with various plugins, and some menu items may cause discomfort or distraction. Utilize WordPress more efficiently by choosing which submenus to display, creating a cleaner and more convenient interface for your work.
